
JVorbis Todo Checklist
----------------------

libvorbis
----------------------
// DONE - Vorbis Comment support added into header

vorbis_encode_init_vbr( vi, 2, 44100, .4f )) - quality should be able to be increased/decresed but not tested yet
finish support for managed bitrate options

Optimize

manual memory cleanup - _vorbis_pull_ripcord, saves values from a mock vorbis_block_alloc to track localstorage offsets and keep memory footprint down

Check multiple loops to combine throughout the main loop

rewrite to let the java garbage collector manage memory more in main loop - ByteStreams or ArrayLists etc

	System.arraycopy everywhere instead of memcpy, memmove
	Arrays.fill instead of memsets and hardloops


add low quality support from aoTuV - http://www.geocities.jp/aoyoume/aotuv/

OOP classes

Get rid of floor1_func, res0_func, map0_func
		_floor_P
		_residue_P
		_map_P

Abstract as j-ogg, jcraft

	(may only be needed for decode or encode other than 2 channels 44100 rate .4f quality)
	_floor_P	(currently only supports floor1)
	_residue_P	(currently only supports res0)
	_mapping_P	(currently only supports mapping0)

	add floor1 (info, look and functions)
		vorbis_info_floor1.java, vorbis_look_floor1.java, oggpack_buffer.java

	add residue0 (info, look) and create residue type 0,1,2 [functions]
		vorbis_info_residue0.java, vorbis_look_residue0.java, oggpack_buffer.java


	add mapping0 (info, look and functions) - *** ilog is actually ilog2 function - see mapping0.c
		vorbis_info_mapping0.java, < no look function >, oggpack_buffer.java

Java signed (>>) to unsigned (>>>) bit shift changes
These all need inteligent checks
vorbisenc.java		4
vorbis_dsp_state	2
mdct_lookup		17
drft_lookup		4
codebook		4
bitrate_manager_state	1


codec_setup_info.java
abstract classes for 
// vorbis_info_mapping
// vorbis_info_floor
// vorbis_info_residue
right now limits to mapping0 floor1 residue0

private_state.java
absctract classes for
// vorbis_look_floor
// vorbis_look_residue
right now limits to residue0 and floor1



vorbis_block.java - conserve memory in vorbis_analysis_blockout
mapping0_forward - this is where the logfft (vbi->pcm) data discrepensies come out to haunt.  main impact is the call to floor_posts[i][PACKETBLOBS/2] = floor1_fit( b.flr[info.floorsubmap[submap]], logmdct, logfft );
call to accumulate_fit( logmask, logmdct, look.sorted_index[i], look.sorted_index[i+1], fits[i], n, info ); sets off the lsfit_acc data when (flr[mdct+i]+info.twofitatten >= flr[i]) is very marginal factions (.00001).  This snowballs to cause the line deltas to return different results than C library.  Basiclly I think it just draws a different sound, cutting or adding in places the C lib does not, and by marginal amounts, but this may have to do with timing as well.  Needs investigation


vorbis_dsp_state.java
need to work System.arraycopy loop to work with more than 2 channels

vorbis_look_psy.java
possible pointer leak and array wrap around.  I doubt it, but thats what i wrote, file hasnt been edited in a while

vorbisenc.java
implementation for more than just VBR encoded files
managed bitrate portions were left out and never documented well

libvorbis.books data package
only imported residue data for 2 channel 44100 Hz audio processesing.
meant to write a script to import the rest of the data ( single channel data?, and higher and lower sampling rates ) once this one was finished (imported by hand :-(), but moved forward and never got back to it.

libvorbis.modes data package
again only impemented the template for 44100 Hz audio a la reside book data
